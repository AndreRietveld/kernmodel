    documentation="AAG = AlwaysOn Availability Groups &#xA;Synchrone replicatie tussen primary replica en secondary replica:&#xA;&#xA;Each set of availability database is hosted by an availability replica. Two types of availability replicas exist: a single primary replica. which hosts the primary databases, and one to eight secondary replicas, each of which hosts a set of secondary databases and serves as a potential failover targets for the availability group. An availability group fails over at the level of an availability replica. An availability replica provides redundancy only at the database levelâ€”for the set of databases in one availability group. Failovers are not caused by database issues such as a database becoming suspect due to a loss of a data file or corruption of a transaction log."/>
