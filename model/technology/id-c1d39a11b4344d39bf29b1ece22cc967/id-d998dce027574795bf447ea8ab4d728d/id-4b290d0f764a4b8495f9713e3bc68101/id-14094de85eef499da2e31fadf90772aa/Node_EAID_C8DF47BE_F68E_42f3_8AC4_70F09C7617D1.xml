    documentation="A Publish-Subscribe Channel works like this: It has one input channel that splits into multiple output channels, one for each subscriber. When an event is published into the channel, the Publish-Subscribe Channel delivers a copy of the message to each of the output channels. Each output channel has only one subscriber, which is only allowed to consume a message once. In this way, each subscriber only gets the message once and consumed copies disappear from their channels.&#xA;&#xA;http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/PublishSubscribeChannel.html"/>
